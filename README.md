# LSUCASM - Linux Server Use Cases: Authentication, Security & Networking

## Introduction
LSUCASM is a personal project documenting my journey in setting up and managing Linux server-based authentication, security monitoring, and networking services. This project is not meant for direct replication but serves as a guide and learning log.

## What I Plan to Do
- **Implement OpenLDAP + Samba** for centralized authentication.
- **Deploy SIEM tools (Wazuh, ELK, Suricata, Zeek)** for security monitoring.
- **Set up DNS & networking services** using Pi-hole, Unbound, and a Linux-based DHCP server.
- **Document the entire process**, including challenges, solutions, and optimizations.

## Technologies & Tools I’m Exploring
- **Authentication:** OpenLDAP, Samba, SSSD, Kerberos
- **Security Monitoring:** Wazuh, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Suricata, Zeek
- **Networking & DNS:** Pi-hole, Unbound, ISC-DHCP-server
- **System Configuration:** Ubuntu Server, Shell scripting

## Progress & Challenges
I’ll be documenting:
- The setup and configuration process for each service.
- Troubleshooting steps for common issues.
- Performance optimizations and best practices.

## Future Considerations
- Enhancing automation with **Ansible** or **Puppet**.
- Adding **Zero Trust** security principles.
- Expanding logging and monitoring with **SIEM rule customization**.

## Why I’m Doing This
This project helps me deepen my understanding of Linux server administration while improving authentication, security, and networking skills. The documentation ensures I have a reference for future projects.

## Follow My Journey
I'll keep updating this repo with my learnings, configurations, and insights.
